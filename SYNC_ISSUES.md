# WebDAV Sync System Issues Analysis

**Date:** 2025-07-27  
**Analyzed by:** Claude Code  

## **Critical Issues:**

### 1. **Race Condition in Sync Queue Processing** (SyncManager.kt:252-253)
- When a page upload fails, both the page data AND failed images are queued for retry
- This could create duplicate entries and inconsistent state
- **Location:** `syncPage()` method lines 252-263

### 2. **Missing Transaction Boundaries**
- Database operations aren't wrapped in transactions, which could lead to partial updates if the app crashes mid-sync

### 3. **Weak Conflict Resolution** (SyncManager.kt:701-708)
- Only compares `updatedAt` timestamps for conflict resolution
- No handling for concurrent edits from different devices
- "Last writer wins" approach could lose data

## **Reliability Issues:**

### 4. **Network Timeout Handling**
- WebDAV client has 5-minute timeouts, but no exponential backoff for retries
- Failed operations go to queue but retry timing is simplistic

### 5. **Image Upload Failure Recovery**
- If page metadata uploads but images fail, the system marks it as "partial success"
- No mechanism to retry just the failed images later

### 6. **Deletion Sync Gap**
- DeletionLog tracks deletions but deletion sync to server not fully implemented
- Could lead to data inconsistency across devices

## **Data Integrity Issues:**

### 7. **No Checksum Validation**
- Large page files are compressed and uploaded, but no integrity checking
- Corrupted uploads might not be detected

### 8. **Sync State Inconsistency**
- `lastSyncTime` is updated optimistically even with partial failures
- Could skip content that should be retried

## **Performance Issues:**

### 9. **Inefficient Incremental Sync**
- Downloads ALL remote files to check timestamps instead of using server-side filtering
- Could be slow with many files

### 10. **Memory Usage**
- Large images are Base64 encoded in JSON, potentially causing OOM
- No streaming for large file uploads

## **Recommended Fixes:**

1. **Implement proper database transactions** for atomic operations
2. **Add exponential backoff** for retry mechanisms  
3. **Implement proper three-way merge** conflict resolution
4. **Add checksum validation** for uploaded content
5. **Separate image retry logic** from page retry logic
6. **Actually implement deletion syncing** to server
7. **Use content-based sync** instead of timestamp-only conflict resolution
8. **Add proper queue deduplication** to prevent race conditions
9. **Implement streaming uploads** for large files
10. **Add server-side filtering** for incremental sync

## **Architecture Notes:**

The sync system has good architectural foundations with:
- Proper separation of concerns (SyncManager, WebDAVClient, SyncSerializer)
- Queue-based retry mechanism
- Network monitoring integration
- Comprehensive logging

But needs hardening around edge cases and failure scenarios.
